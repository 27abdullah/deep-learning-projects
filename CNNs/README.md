# CNN-Work
This repository includes some CNN code that I have written for a pattern recognition and analysis course that I am currently taking at university.


## Eigenfaces Analysis
This project involves comparing the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with a Random Forest regressor against a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial recognition.

* Dataset: Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW)
* Models:
   * PCA + Random Forest Regressor: Uses PCA to reduce dimensionality and a Random Forest to predict facial features.
   * CNN: A simple CNN with three convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dense layers.
* Objective: Match faces to names and analyze performance.


## DawnBench Challenge
In this challenge, we focus on classifying images from the CIFAR10 dataset using a CNN model that is optimized for training efficiency and accuracy.

* Dataset: CIFAR10
* Model: A CNN that achieves greater than 93% accuracy and can be trained in less than 30 minutes on UQâ€™s HPC.
* Classes: Airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Brain MRI Generation
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic brain MRI images.

* Dataset: OASIS
* Models: 
   * Discriminative Network: Identifies fake brain MRI images.
   * Generative Network: Creates realistic brain MRI images.
* Objective: Generate high-quality brain MRI images for research purposes.
